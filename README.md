# PacMan

# Project Title: "PacMan Exercise"

## Description: This is the game where the player controls PacMan who travels inside a maze trying to eat all the dots while avoiding the colorful ghosts. You're not going to build the full PacMan game in this activity. However, you will be building a feature of this game, which displays and moves PacMan from one side of the screen to the other.

## How to Run: You should run this by copying all the files in this repo and test it by yourself.
